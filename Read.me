Personal finance calculator created for my Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming class final creative project. Created using MongoDB, JavaScript, React.js, Express.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.

Users can log and track their transactions, which can be categorized by color. The users current running balance is calculated and recorded at the top of the page.
